"""Every advertised example must actually parse.

Regression cover for #105: `dg usage` shipped three examples, two of which the
command could not parse (`--days`, `--start`/`--end` against real options
`--start-date`/`--end-date`). The help text contradicted its own options list
eight lines further down.

This matters beyond `--help`. The same `examples` array is what
`--agent-friendly` emits, so an agent asking the CLI how to use itself was
handed commands that fail. A sweep at the time this test was written found
four broken examples across three commands, so the class needed a gate rather
than three fixes.

Parsing only -- `parse_args` resolves the command and validates the options
without invoking the handler, so nothing here touches the network.
