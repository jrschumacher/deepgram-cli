## Documentation by Topic

### Speech-to-Text (STT)

Transcribe audio and video into text. Deepgram ships two actively maintained, next-gen model families — pick the one that matches your use case.

- **Nova** (`/v1/listen`) — general-purpose transcription (captions, subtitles, batch files, live streams). Rich feature set including intelligence overlays (diarize, summarize, sentiment, topics, intents).
- **Flux STT** (`/v2/listen`) — conversational-audio transcription for voice agents and interactive assistants. Built-in turn-taking (EOT events, mid-session reconfig).

Docs:
- [STT Getting Started (Nova)](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/stt/getting-started)
- [Flux STT Quickstart](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/flux/quickstart)
- [Nova 3 → Flux STT migration](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/flux/nova-3-migration)
- [Flux STT language prompting](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/flux/language-prompting)

### Text-to-Speech (TTS)

Convert text into natural-sounding speech. Deepgram ships two TTS model families on separate endpoints — the voices do not overlap.

- **Aura** (`/v1/speak`) — the broadest voice catalog (English, Spanish, German, Dutch, French, Italian, Japanese) and compressed/containerized output. Use for one-shot synthesis and any non-English voice.
- **Flux TTS** (`/v2/speak`) — streaming-first, voice-agent-first synthesis. Turn-based lifecycle, barge-in with spoken-text feedback, and prosody that carries across turns. English at launch.

### Text and Audio Intelligence

Analyze text and audio for sentiment, topics, intents, summaries, and more.

### Self-Hosted Deployments

Run Deepgram on your own infrastructure.

## SDK-Specific Skills

For language-idiomatic code patterns (imports, async idioms, error handling, type shapes), install the Deepgram SDK's own skills. Every Deepgram SDK publishes 7 product skills:

```bash
npx skills add deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk     # Python
npx skills add deepgram/deepgram-js-sdk         # JavaScript / TypeScript
npx skills add deepgram/deepgram-java-sdk       # Java
npx skills add deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk         # Go
npx skills add deepgram/deepgram-rust-sdk       # Rust
npx skills add deepgram/deepgram-dotnet-sdk     # C# / .NET
```

Swift and Kotlin SDK skills are not listed because those repositories are not public and `npx skills add` cannot reach them. For browser work, open the `browser-agent` skill: it covers the four Browser Agent SDK packages published on npm (`@deepgram/agents`, `@deepgram/react`, `@deepgram/ui`, `@deepgram/agents-widget`).
